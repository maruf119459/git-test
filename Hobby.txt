My hobby is travelling. 
I can watch many different birds and hear their sweet songs and unique calls. I can see many beautiful and colourful butterflies. I also learn about many interesting natural phenomena of the jungle. I can watch the kingfisher catching a fish and eating it. I can watch a weaver bird get into its nest or a munia build its nest. I can watch from close quarters the wild creatures that I can never see in a town or city where there is human habitation.
